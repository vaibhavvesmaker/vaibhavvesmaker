🤹‍♀️ Fun Fact
I’m obsessed with experimental cooking—whipping up new recipes while listening to my favorite music playlist. If you see a random 2 a.m. commit, it’s likely me perfecting a script… right after perfecting a lasagna. <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEjHCMvQMgE0G8vIc/giphy.gif" width="45" />
